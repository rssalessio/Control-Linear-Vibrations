\chapter{System Identification}
The system considered can be easily modelled and identified without the need to use black-box identification to identify the system. \\ For completeness both \emph{white-box} and \emph{grey-box} identification were used.\\ \\
First of all the problem of whether to consider a \emph{closed} or \emph{open} loop system is considered. In fact \emph{back-emf} can be seen as a gain acting on the closed loop.\\ \\
Then, using both \emph{white-box} and \emph{grey-box} identification we identified the main parameters of the system: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Resistance and inductance for the motor.
\item Mass, stiffness and damping for the cart and the springs.
\end{enumerate}
Next identification of non-linearities are considered.
