\chapter{Team introduction}
The team is composed by 3 people, all holding a B.Sci. in Engineering not obtained at Politecnico di Milano. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Alessio Russo}: holds a B.Sci. degree in Computer Engineering, enrolled at the M.Sci. degree Automation and Control Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. Because of his interest in mathematics he prefers to deals with problems using precise and defined solutions. Currently he's also an ASP student, and his thesis will focus on the implementation of adaptive and robust controllers for the control of unmodelled dynamics of quadrotors, with the use of neural networks and L1 adaptive control techniques.
