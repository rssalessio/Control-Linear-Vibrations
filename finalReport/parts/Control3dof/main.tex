\section{LQG Control Design}

The structure of this control scheme is the same as the 1 degree of freedom scenario and it is discussed in the previous chapter. In this section we only show the tuning and final results.\\

Obviously the state matrix includes also the other two carts and we must take that into account when tuning the weights on $Q$, whilst the weight on the control input $R$ is again scalar. The final tuning was output of a trial and error approach which led to the matrices
\begin{equation}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0.1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
R=1
\end{equation}
which weights the positions of the second and third carts, being the state vector defined as $x = \left[ i,\, x_1,\, x_2,\, x_3,\, \dot{x}_1,\, \dot{x}_2,\, \dot{x}_3 \right] $. We needed to weight also $x_2$ because the cart was presenting some oscillations in the transient which were due to the too strong control action.\\

Since we are not including any integral action, we need to consider a compensator on the reference which can guarantee zero error at steady state. This gain is computed as the inverse of the dc gain of the controlled plant.
