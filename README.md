# Project Organization

This repo is organised as follows:
- Documentation contains generic papers or datasheets which were helpful during the project
- finalPresentation and finalReport contains the deliverable for the evaluation
- src contains the implementation of our solution

In particular the folder "src/" is divided in subfolders which kept distinguished the different stage/module of the project:
- Functions/ contains matlab scripts which were helpful during the whole project
- Models/ contains the state-space models of our plant
- Test/ contains the actual output of this project

Any folder in Test/ contains the Matlab or Simulink model which performs the test and the recorded data.
